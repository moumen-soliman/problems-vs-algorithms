###Problem 1 Design
Basic binary search credit to Udacity
creates array one less than input number
Checks if supplied number is greater than, equal to, or less than initialized square
If the input matches, return the square root
Otherwise, there is no perfect square, so return -1

###Time complexity
O(logN) with binary search

###Space complexity
O(N) - array is initialized inside function, size is dependent on input number
