In this problem, I have to write a code to find the maximum and minimum number and return the tuple of maximum and minimum numbers.
So, to solve this question, first I have created a list which contains two numbers, and intialized with minimum possible number in python for finding maximum in the list and intialized with maximum possible number in python for finding minimum in the list.
Then I iterated through the list & then made comparisions for finding the maximum & minimum of the number.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
