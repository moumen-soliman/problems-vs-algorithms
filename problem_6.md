###Problem 6
Uses linear search to incrementally go through each element in array
for each i in integer, check if value is greater than largest or less than first
update values according to results

###Time complexity
O(n) - loop dependent on size of input array

###Space complexity
O(n)  - only two values take up space throughout operation, input is a variable list which is a large unknown input
