In this problem, I have to maximize the sum of the two formed number. So, first I iterated through the array then I stored the frequencies of all the digits i.e. 0 to 9. As, I have created an array to store all the frequencies.
After creating the array and storing the frequencies, I have iterated through the array from last & appended the numbers to form the two numbers and finally joined to create the list.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)
